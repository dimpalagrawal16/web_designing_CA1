    <!--description-->
    <p><b>Mona Lisa is an iconic portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1519, likely depicting Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a Florentine merchant. The masterpiece, housed in the Louvre Museum, is renowned for the subject's enigmatic expression and the painting's atmospheric illusionism, becoming the world's most famous and parodied artwork.</b></p>

    <p><b>The Starry Night, often called simply Starry Night, is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.</b></p>

    <p><b>French painter Claude Monet painted a series of 250 pieces known as Water Lilies between 1840 and 1926 - it's exactly what it sounds like, 250 paintings depicting a water lily pond from his backyard. While this might not be one individual painting, considering the collection is spread amongst the most renowned galleries of the world, the series is a deserving installment on this list.</b></p>
